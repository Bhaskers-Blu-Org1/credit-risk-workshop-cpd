# Pre-work

This section is broken up into the following steps:

1. [Download or Clone the repo](#1-download-or-clone-the-repo)
1. [About the data set](#2-about-the-data-set)
1. [(Optional) Seeding our Db2 Warehouse database](#3-optional-seeding-our-db2-warehouse-database)
1. [Creating a new Cloud Pak for Data project](#4-creating-a-new-cloud-pak-for-data-project)
1. [Create a Space for Machine Learning Deployments](#5-create-a-space-for-machine-learning-deployments)

## 1. Download or clone the repo

Various parts of this workshop will require the attendee to upload files or run scripts that we've stored in the repository. So let's get that done early on, you'll need [`git`](https://git-scm.com) on your laptop to clone the repository directly, or access to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to download the zip file.

To Download, go to the [GitHub repo for this workshop](https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd)

![download workshop zip](../.gitbook/assets/images/prework/pre-work-git-zip-download.png)

Alternately, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd
cd credit-risk-workshop-cpd
```

## 2. About the data set

The data set used for this workshop is originally from Watson Analytics and was used on a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) project, it contains information about customer churn for a Telecommunications company. The data is split into three CSV files and are located in the [data](https://github.com/IBM/credit-risk-workshop-cpd/tree/master/data/split) directory of this repository.

### **[financial_data.csv](../../data/split/financial_data.csv)**

This file has the following attributes:

* CustomerID (hex number, used as Primary Key)
* CheckingStatus
* LoanDuration
* CreditHistory
* LoanPurpose
* LoanAmount

### **[non_financial_data.csv](../../data/split/non_financial_data.csv)**

This file has the following attributes:

* CustomerID (hex number, used as Primary Key)
* ExistingSavings
* EmploymentDuration
* InstallmentPercent
* Sex
* OthersOnLoan
* CurrentResidenceDuration
* OwnsProperty
* Age
* InstallmentPlans
* Housing
* ExistingCreditsCount
* Job
* Dependents
* Telephone
* ForeignWorker
* Risk

### **[personal_data_id.csv](../../data/split/personal_data_id.csv)**

This file has the following attributes:

* CustomerID (hex number, used as Primary Key)
* first_name
* last_name
* email
* street address
* city
* state
* postal code

## 3. (Optional) Seeding our Db2 Warehouse database

We'll need a place to store our data. For this workshop we've opted to use Db2 Warehouse on our local Cloud Pak for Data cluster. Note that CP4D can work with any Database with a JDBC connector, so this is only one of many choices.

### Load Data into Local DB2 Warehouse

These instructions are for loading the data into the local CP4D version of DB2 Warehouse. They will be similar for the IBM Cloud version.

Click the (☰) hamburger menu in the upper left corner and choose `Collect` -> `My data`:

![Choose collect -> My data](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/collectMyData.png)

Go to the *Databases* tab, click on the 3 vertial lines on the *DB2 Warehouse* tile, and click `Open`:

![Open Service DB2 Warehouse](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/userOpenDB2Warehouse.png)

Under `Menu` choose `Load` and `Load Data`:

![Menu Load Data](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/DB2LoadData.png)

Choose `Browse files`:

![DB2 browse files](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/DB2browseFiles.png)

Navigate to where you cloned this repository, then to `data/split/` and choose `billing.csv`, then click `Next`.

![DB2 navigate to billing.csv](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/navigateToBilling.png)

Choose Schema `NULLIDRA` and click `+ New table`. Under "New Table Name" type "BILLING" and click `Create`, then `Next`.

![DB2 choose schema and create table](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/DB2schemaAndTableCreate.png)

Accept the defaults and click `Next`. Click `Begin Load`.

![DB2 load final](../.gitbook/assets/images/dv/DB2loadFinal.png)

Repeat for the `products.csv` file, naming the table `PRODUCTS` and the `customer-service.csv` file, naming the table `CUSTOMERS`.

### Examine connection information

You can see connection information by going to *Menu* -> *Connection Information*. Here you can see instructions for various platforms (Linux, Mac, PowerLinux, Windows, zLinux) and the information you need to connect, with the exception of the *password*. The *password* is only available to users with *Admin* privileges:

![DB2 connection info](../.gitbook/assets/images/db2/DB2connectionInformation.png)

## 4. Creating a new Cloud Pak for Data project

At this point of the workshop we will be using Cloud Pak for Data for the remaining steps.

### Log into Cloud Pak for Data

Launch a browser and navigate to your Cloud Pak for Data deployment

> **NOTE** Your instructor will provide a URL and credentials to log into Cloud Pak for Data!

![Cloud Pak for Data login](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-login.png)

### Create a new project

Go the (☰) menu and click *Projects*

![(☰) Menu -> Projects](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-projects-menu.png)

Click on *New project*

![Start a new project](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-new-project.png)


Either [Create project from file](#create-project-from-file-for-openscale-configuration) if you are doing the manual configuration of OpenScale for this workshop,or [Create a blank project](#create-empty-project-if-you-are-not-using-openscale-configuration) if you aren't using OpenScale, or using OpenScale with the Fast Path configuration.

#### Create project from file for OpenScale configuration

Select the _*Create a project from a sample or file*_option:

![Create project from file](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-create-project-from-sample.png)

Navigate to where you cloned this repository, then to `notebooks/` and choose `openscalelab.zip`. Give the project a name and click `Create`:

![Browse for project files](../.gitbook/assets/images/openscale-config/openscale-config-browse-for-project-files.png)

#### Create empty project if you are not using OpenScale configuration

Click on the top tile for `Create an empty project`:

![Create an empty project](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-create-empty-project.png)

Give the project a unique name and click `Create`:

![Pick a name](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-new-project-name.png)

## 5. Create a Space for Machine Learning Deployments

Go the (☰) menu and click `Analyze` -> `Analytics deployments`:

![(☰) Menu -> Analytics deployments](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-choose-analytics-deployments.png)

Click on `+ New deployment space`):

![Add New deployment space](../.gitbook/assets/images/manage/cpd-add-new-deployment-space.png)

Give your deployment space a unique name, optional description, then click `Create`. You will use this space later when you deploy a machine learning model.
